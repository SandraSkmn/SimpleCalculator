# Simple Calculator
Calculator that handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and simple trigonometric functions

Rather than using the eval function in JS, I coded the logic of the calculator myself. Will add functionality for parentheses, better handling of negative numbers and saving previous answers in future.
